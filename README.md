# Diabetes-Prediction-Project
This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on several factors. It consists of a dataset file named `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv` and a Jupyter Notebook file named `notebook.ipynb` that contains the code and analysis.

Dataset:
The `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv` file contains 100,000 rows and 9 columns, including gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes.

Notebook:
The `notebook.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file contains the code and analysis for the diabetes prediction project. 
It includes steps such as importing libraries and data, 
-- removing duplicates --
-- data visualization --
-- one-hot encoding --
-- normalizing data using MinMaxScaler --
-- balancing class values using SMOTE --
-- training algorithms with different hyperparameters -- 
-- splitting data into training/testing/validating datasets --
-- training a Random Forest Classifier -- 
-- calculating accuracy score -- 
-- creating a confusion matrix and classification report -- 
-- applying PCA for dimensionality reduction and re-training the model -- 
Please refer to the `notebook.ipynb` file for detailed code implementation and further analysis.
